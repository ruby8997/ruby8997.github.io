      Global warming has become overwhelming and dangerous. Moreover, shopping choices in daily life can
intensify or lessen a household’s impact on the environment. Because the food system was responsible for
34% of global carbon emissions in 2015, what individuals eat and where they purchase food influence a
household’s food carbon footprint. With their unique shopping environment (e.g., lower prices, larger
package sizes, membership fees), club stores have played a significant role in household food purchases. In
this study, we examine whether and why shopping at warehouse club stores affects a household’s food
carbon footprint. Using the process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) model and Nielsen Consumer Panel
data, we calculate the household food carbon footprint from 2007-2017 and measure the effect of shopping
at club stores on household carbon life. To address concerns about self-selection into the club store shopping
treatment, we implement a recently advanced machine learning(ML) method of causal
inference—generalized synthetic control (GSC)—to identify the causal treatment effect. This method unifies
the synthetic control and interactive fixed effects model that incorporates unit-specific intercepts interacting
with time-varying coefficients. We find consistently that households generate quarterly 10-14% more per
capita carbon emissions since purchasing their groceries at club stores. Moreover, we reveal that the unique
features of a club store’s setting—such as lower prices and larger package sizes—can explain the increases in
household food carbon emissions but are not the main drivers for this treatment effect. We also observe that
the heterogeneous club store carbon effect is more significant for households with smaller sizes and lower
income levels. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research introducing the carbon emission
calculation model and exploring the sustainability of household grocery shopping in the marketing area. Our
implementation with the GSC method also enriches the applications of causal inference with ML algorithms
in a marketing setting.

      Crowdfunding platforms—a fast-growing method for entrepreneurs to finance their ventures—are struggling
with improving crowdfunding campaigns’ market performance, as platforms expand to include more diverse
participants. In this paper, we examine how a platform policy changing the platform size and participation
composition (i.e., donors vs. buyers) impacts platform participant behaviors and market outcomes. We use
Indiegogo’s launch of Generosity.com for charity campaigns. Our results show a higher probability of
reaching funding goals for the Indiegogo platform’s campaigns after the platform split-up. Such changes are
driven by fewer campaigns being launched on Indiegogo after the platform change, as well as more costly
visual information (e.g., images videos) provided by the campaign creators. After the platform modification,
buyers contribute more to campaigns owing to sensitivity to such campaign information. Also, we collect
data on Kickstarter campaigns to test the robustness of our results and use the Difference-in-Difference
analysis to confirm our findings. These results are consistent with the notion that entrepreneurs’
information disclosure strategy is driven by potential backers’ motivation to support the campaign. The
study offers several managerial implications for platforms, as well as for their participants.

      Identifying the right influencers for brands is key to a successful social media marketing campaign. This
study proposes a data-driven framework to examine the value of communication styles in social media
engagement. We use a sample of over 28,000 real Facebook influencers spanning from nano to
mega-influencers. We find that communication styles, narrative styles, and intentions extracted by text
mining algorithms from influencers’ posted messages affect social media engagement and social interactions.
We also reveal that the impacts of communication style on audience engagement are moderated by
influencer types (i.e., nano, micro, macro, and mega-influencers). Our research provides managerial insights
for brands to consider carefully social media communication styles when collaborating with influencers.
