    Climate change is having a consequential effect on the environment, and shopping choices in daily life
can intensify or lessen a household’s impact on the environment. Because the food system is responsible for
34% of global carbon emissions, what to eat and where to purchase food influence a household’s food carbon
footprint. With their unique shopping environment (e.g., lower prices, larger package sizes, membership fees),
club stores play a significant role in households’ food purchases. In this study, we examine whether and why
shopping at warehouse club stores affects a household’s food carbon footprint. Using the process-based Life
Cycle Assessment (LCA) model and Nielsen Consumer Panel data, we calculate the household food carbon
footprint between 2007 and 2017 and measure the effect of shopping at club stores on household carbon life.
To address the concerns about self-selecting into the club store shopping treatment, we implement a recently
advanced machine learning method of causal inference—generalized synthetic control (GSC)—to identify the
causal treatment effect. We find a consistent average treatment effect in which households generate 9-15%
more per capita carbon emissions quarterly since purchasing groceries at club stores. Moreover, we investigate
whether the unique store shopping environment of club stores explain the increases in household food carbon
emissions, but those impacts are not consistent across categories. We also observe the heterogeneous treatment
effect that the club store carbon effect is more significant for households with smaller sizes or lower income
levels.To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research introducing the carbon emission calculation model
and exploring the sustainability of household grocery shopping in the marketing area. Our implementation
with the GSC method also enriches the applications of causal inference with ML algorithms in a marketing
setting. Our findings provide practical implications for policymakers and grocery retailers.

      Crowdfunding platforms are a fast-growing approach for entrepreneurs to finance their new product devel-
opments. Improving crowdfunding campaigns’ performance with more diverse participants after platform
expansion, however, is difficult. In this paper, the authors investigate how platform specialization changing
in platform size and backers’ composition (donors vs. buyers) influences participant behaviors and campaign
outcomes with the Indiegogo platform split-up. Their results show a higher probability of reaching funding
goals for campaigns on a reward-based platform (main platform) after it launched a new platform for donation-
based campaigns. Crowdfunding platform participants’ strategic responses to the platform split-up drive such
improvements in crowdfunding outcomes. First, fewer campaigns are launched on the main platform after the
platform split-up. Second, creators provide more visual campaign information (i.e., images and videos here)
to mitigate information asymmetry that is more of a concern due to a larger proportion of buyers among
backers. Buyers are more sensitive to such visual information than donors and, therefore, contribute more to
campaigns after the platform split-up. These findings are consistent with the notion that potential backers’
motivations for supporting a campaign drive creators’ information disclosure strategy. The study provides
important managerial implications for platforms and participants.

      Identifying the right influencers for brands is key to a successful social media marketing campaign. This
study proposes a data-driven framework to examine the value of communication styles in social media
engagement. We use a sample of over 28,000 real Facebook influencers spanning from nano to
mega-influencers. We find that communication styles, narrative styles, and intentions extracted by text
mining algorithms from influencers’ posted messages affect social media engagement and social interactions.
We also reveal that the impacts of communication style on audience engagement are moderated by
influencer types (i.e., nano, micro, macro, and mega-influencers). Our research provides managerial insights
for brands to consider carefully social media communication styles when collaborating with influencers.
