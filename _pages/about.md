Hey, thanks for stopping by! ðŸ‘‹

I am a covex combination of quantitative marketing researcher and data scientist.

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate at [Krannert School of Management](https://krannert.purdue.edu/), Purdue University. My research interests are mainly in quantitative marketing, causal inference using machine learning, digital marketing. During my Ph.D. studies, my thesis is conducted under the supervison of [Prof. Ting Zhu](https://krannert.purdue.edu/directory/bio.php?username=zhu640).

I received my Master in Marketing from Purdue univeristy, my Master and Bachelor in [Software Engineering](https://www.nju.edu.cn/EN/7f/70/c7136a163696/page.htm) from Nanjing Unversity. I also worked as a financial manager at the [Agriculture Bank of China](https://www.abchina.com/en/), a full-time intern data scientist in eBay China Development Center, and a full-time intern software engineer at [Baidu.Inc](https://ir.baidu.com/).

In my spare time, I enjoy doing sports (mostly running, cycling, gymming and swimming), traveling, and watching football games with friends and family. I also like reading history, philosophy, and art. 

 
Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
